\section{Conclusion}


This paper proposes time reversed electromagnetic wave propagation as a new
approach for wireless power transfer.
%
Our experiments demonstrate that the spatial profile of reconstruction voltage
is very tightly confined to the area surrounding the intended receiving antenna,
and follows a $\left|sinc(x)\right|$ profile.
%
Further, we successfully demonstrate the ability to focus time reversed signals
onto a moving target in a ray-chaotic scattering environment.
%
We believe that, with improvements to the transmitter and receiver, time reversal
could provide a viable approach for WPT in certain environments.
