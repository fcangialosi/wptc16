We investigate the application of time reversed electromagnetic wave propagation
to transmit energy to a moving target in a reverberant environment.
%
``Time reversal'' is a signal focusing method that exploits the time reversal
invariance of the lossless wave equation to direct signals on a single point
inside a complex scattering environment.
%
In this work, we explore the properties of time reversed microwave pulses in a
low-loss ray-chaotic chamber.
%
We measure the spatial profile of the collapsing wavefront around the target
antenna, and demonstrate that time reversal can be used to transfer energy to a
receiver in motion.
%
We discuss the results of these experiments, and explore their implications for
a wireless power transmission system based on time reversal.
